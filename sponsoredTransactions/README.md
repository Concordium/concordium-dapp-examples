# Sponsored Transactions Web Application

The example project included in this repository serves as a working example of how to integrate sponsored transactions with smart contracts on the Concordium blockchain. The project has a front-end and a back-end.

To set up the project locally, complete the steps in the `READ.me` file in the `front-end` repo and then complete the steps in the `READ.me` file in the `back-end` repo.

Alternatively, follow the steps to deploy the docker container in the `READ.me` file in the `back-end` repo. This docker container will set up the front-end as well as the back-end.
