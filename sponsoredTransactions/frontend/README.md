# Sponsored Transactions Web Application

The example project included in this repository serves as a working example of how to integrate sponsored transactions with smart contracts on the Concordium blockchain. This web app supports the following flows with the browser wallet (or wallet connect):

-   Register a public key (associated with the account from your wallet) in the smart contract.
-   Compute the message of a sponsored updateOperator transaction => Sign it with the wallet => Submit the signature and some input parameters to the `/submitUpdateOperator` backend endpoint.
-   Mint an NFT to your wallet => Compute the message of a sponsored transfer transaction => Sign it with the wallet => Submit the signature and some input parameters to the `/submitTransfer` backend endpoint.

The backend creates a sponsored transaction and submits it to the `permit` function in the smart contract {index: SPONSORED_TX_CONTRACT_INDEX, subindex: 0}. You can look up the SPONSORED_TX_CONTRACT_INDEX in the `./src/constants.ts` file. The backend returns the transaction hash to the frontend.

Note: Use the same smart contract index for the frontend and backend. In other words, use the SPONSORED_TX_CONTRACT_INDEX from the `./src/constants.ts` file (frontend folder) when starting the backend server.

Note:
The smart contract {index: SPONSORED_TX_CONTRACT_INDEX, subindex: 0} can be found [here](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-rust-smart-contracts/tree/main/examples/cis3-nft-sponsored-txs).

## Prerequisites

-   Browser wallet extension must be installed in Google Chrome and the Concordium testnet needs to be selected or a mobile wallet needs to be set up that supports wallet connect in order to view smart contract details or submit transactions.

## Running the sponsored txs example (without backend -> submitting the sponsored transaction to chain will fail)

-   Run `yarn install` in this folder.
-   Run `yarn build` in a terminal in this folder.
-   Run `yarn start`.
-   Open URL logged in console (typically http://127.0.0.1:8080).

To have hot-reload (useful for development), do the following instead:

-   Run `yarn watch` in a terminal.
-   Run `yarn start` in another terminal.
-   Open URL logged in console (typically http://127.0.0.1:8080).

## Running the sponsored txs example (with backend -> submitting the sponsored transaction to chain will work)

-   Run `yarn install` in this folder.
-   Run `yarn build` in a terminal in this folder.

This creates a `dist` folder which can be served via the backend. Start the backend server by following the [README.md](../backend/README.md)

## Using yarn (on unix/macOS systems)
Some of the node modules we use have Windows-type line endings (\r\n), instead of unix line endings (\n), which causes problems when using the yarn package manager.

If you see an error message similar to this when executing `yarn start`, then you've run into the problem:
```shell
env: node\r: No such file or directory
```

Use `npm install` instead of `yarn install` in the above command. `npm` will correct the line ending.
