## Yarn checks

Use `yarn fmt` and `yarn lint` before committing to ensure consistent formatting and adherence to common style.

##Â Rust checks

This repository's CI automatically checks formatting and common problems in Rust.

Changes to any of the Rust packages must be such that:

-   `cargo clippy --all` produces no warnings
-   `rust fmt` makes no changes.

## Build

Build the yarn components with: 

```bash
yarn build
```

Build the Rust project from the directory root by running 

```shell
cargo build --locked -p cis2-market --release
```

This produces a single binary `target/release/cis2-market`.

## Deploy

Uses [`concordium-client`](https://developer.concordium.software/en/mainnet/net/references/concordium-client.html) to deploy the contract to the chain.
Uses `node.testnet.concordium.com` node for deployment.

```bash
yarn deploy wallet-account
```

**Here `wallet-account` refers to the account which you have setup in [`concordium-client`](https://developer.concordium.software/en/mainnet/net/references/concordium-client.html)**
